#GetHelp

This project creates a Graphical interface for a user to find information about
resources they can use to get out of poverty as well as resources to help them
survive their journey through poverty


##Usage

To use this program you launch the Jar file and open a new window where you
will be presented with options for food, shelter, health services, education
work force, and childcare. Once you click on one of those tabs you will be taken
to resources related to those things.

There is also a community tab where a user can go to reach out to other users of
the app to get help.

##Algorithm details

The code uses jsoup to scrape data from the relevant websites to present to the
user within the app.


##Future goals

In the future we would want to expand the apps resources as well as develop a want
to help section for people who want to help others get out of poverty.

We would also like to develop a more sophisticated algorithm to scrape data
from the web and make it cleaner looking as this is merely a prototype to show the
design idea we did not have the time to do this.
